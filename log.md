# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 33: January 19, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued with Chapter 5 - Themes, Colors, and Polish. Completed the section on CSS Invert Filter. Completed Exercise 5.03. Watched the Exercise 5.03 screencast. Updated my GitHub Pages site.

**Thoughts:** Quick and easy way to create a dark theme. No real tweaking with code, just a simplified version of the last two day's workflow.

### Day 32: January 18, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued with Chapter 5 - Themes, Colors, and Polish. Completed the section on Creating a Dark Theme with the HSL Function. Completed Exercise 5.02. Watched the Exercise 5.02 screencast. Updated my GitHub Pages site.

**Thoughts:** Very similar exercise to the previous one, except using HSL instead of hex values for colors. Getting quite used to this now. Certainly a lot easier than I first thought. Thinking of doing my own custom theme when I've finished the chapter.

### Day 31: January 17, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued with Chapter 5 - Themes, Colors, and Polish. Completed Exercise 5.01. Watched the Exercise 5.01 screencast. Updated my GitHub Pages site.

**Thoughts:** Turned out that altering the CSS code for the WordPress page wasn't as complicated as I'd imagined it would be. Once you get past the unfamiliar class names, and use the browser Developer Tools to identify specific elements, it was quite straightforward to alter the look and feel of the page.

### Day 30: January 16, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued with Chapter 5 - Themes, Colors, and Polish. Completed the section on The Markup. Completed the section on Inverting Colors. Completed the section on New HTML Elements in the Theme. Completed the section on New CSS Background Properties.

**Thoughts:** Made steady progress with Chapter 5. The supplied WordPress HTML code is very complex. A lot of convoluted class names. If I'm going to work with WordPress in the future, I'm either going to have a find a way to produce some cleaner, less messier code, or I'm going to have spend a very long time getting my head round WordPress.

### Day 29: January 15, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Started Chapter 5 - Themes, Colors, and Polish. Read the Overview and the Introduction. Started reading the section on The Markup.

**Thoughts:** Made a very gentle start to Chapter 5. Thought I deserved a light day after working hard the last few days on forms. Also gave me a chance to enjoy catching up with a few #100DaysOfCode tweets and Twitter friends. Such a good community feel on there. And I have to admit that on more than one occasion, it's the accountability factor that keeps me going some days and keeps me focused & on-track.

### Day 28: January 14, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Completed Chapter 4 - Forms. Completed Activity 4.01 and watched the Activity 4.01 screencast. Read the Summary. Completed Quiz 4. Updated my GitHub Pages site.

**Thoughts:** Yay! Chapter 4 completed. This was a tough chapter to go through, but totally worth it. Learnt lots about forms, especially how to style them. Picked up some really good info on working with in-built browser verification, and some great tactics for approaching how to work with form layout. But must admit, happy to move onto another topic now. Got 2 questions wrong on the quiz - but again, down to confusing or ambiguous answers, so no biggie.

### Day 27: January 13, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued with Chapter 4 - Forms. Completed Exercises 4.02 and 4.03. Watched the Exercise 4.02 and 4.03 screencasts. Updated my GitHub Pages site.

**Thoughts:** Built some really good-looking forms today. Very pleased with my progress - but styling those forms is a bit of a slog with so many components to work on. Got a little diverted with distractions once again. Really need to master controlling the urge to look and play around with other resources while I'm working on something.

### Day 26: January 12, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued with Chapter 4 - Forms. Working through the section on Styling Form Elements. Completed Exercise 4.02 and watched the Exercise 4.02 screencast. Updated my GitHub Pages site.

**Thoughts:** Forms take a lot of CSS styling to start making them look good (and improve their usability), but really worth it. Made a simple syntax error in the exercise code, which held me up but also made me dig a little futher into how relative and absolute positioning work. Also got diverted by looking at how to use :focus in combination with :valid so form could offer feedback on a field-by-field basis rather than evaluating the whole form at a time. Noticed that the supplied code for this exercise was quite different to that in the book, so will build that version too. Must check all the other supplied code to see if there's any other different code that could be worth trying out and experimenting with.

### Day 25: January 11, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued with Chapter 4 - Forms. Completed the section on Form Elements. Completed Exercise 4.01 and watched the Exercise 4.01 screencast. Updated my GitHub Pages site.

**Thoughts:** Carried on working with forms. Now covered all the form elements and will start working on styling them tomorrow. Helped someone on Twitter today with a JS question. Used my Jon Duckett book to help with my answer. Forgot how great his books are. So quickly looked up what he had to say on forms in his HTML & CSS book. Definitely going to be worth going through his books again. Might do this straight after finishing this book instead of moving on to some others on my reading list. Note: nothing wrong with my current book, just maybe need to consolidate my learning. It's always good to hear the same topics explained in a different "voice" and I always learn something new that was previously left out or skirted over. Plus it helps combat imposter syndrome when you spend 95% of your time nodding in agreement, and 5% going "Aha!". Might make my progress a little slower, but my goal is to master the topics, not just check a box and move on with very little understanding. That's also why I type out every single bit of code - never just reading alone, never copy & paste, and very rarely use auto-complete (unless it's really basic code that I know off the top of my head). Makes my typing faster and builds up my muscle-memory too!

### Day 24: January 10, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Started Chapter 4 - Forms. Read the Overview and the Introduction. Started reading the section on Form Elements.

**Thoughts:** Back to the book "proper". Started Chapter 4 on Forms. Not the most interesting topic for some people, but I really like all the various form elements that modern browsers natively support, rather than relying on JS. Also flicked ahead and love the way the chapter deals with styling the forms too. It was good to focus on the exercises and activity over the last few days, but it's a nice change of pace to be going steady again, learning about new elements one by one. Also found some new learning resources that I've downloaded and put to one-side for either casually looking through on a break or for committing to after I've finished this book. Starting to get a bit more disciplined when it comes to focus!

### Day 23: January 9, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Completed Chapter 3 - Text and Typography. Completed Activity 3.01 and watched the Activity 3.01 screencast. Read the Summary. Completed Quiz 3.

**Thoughts:** Spent a lot of time on this activity. Using the supplied example article was easy enough, but the book asked the reader to choose an article from a recent copy of a newspaper. You then had to recreate it using semantic markup and CSS to get the layout to match the original as closely as possible. This was really tricky. Had to use W3Schools to look up how to work with multiple columns. Also had to tweak the CSS again and again to try and get it just right. My final version is very static (because the layout is supposed to match the printed original). I would have approached it differently if doing a more natural, fluid web layout. Made me look forward to the chapter on responsive web design. Finished the day off with Quiz 3. I got 93% this time round - knew the answer to the one I got "wrong", but didn't understand the way it was described in the set of answers we were given, so very happy I seem to have taken in all the new material in this chapter.

### Day 22: January 8, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Chapter 3 - Text and Typography. Completed Exercises 3.05 and 3.06. Watched the Exercise 3.05 and Exercise 3.06 screencasts.

**Thoughts:** Worked late into the night getting the product cards just right, and then making sure everything in the final page matched the wireframes and screenshots from the book. Took quite a bit of tweaking as there were a few things missing in the instructions and the screencasts. Not that it bothered me... I enjoyed fixing the code and got a real buzz out of getting it to work in the end. Very proud of the work I've done. Certainly the most complicated and well-designed page I've ever put together. Three weeks in and I'm really starting to see some progress. This was especially welcome as the day or so before didn't go too well. Putting those days behind me, and on the up now.

### Day 21: January 7, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Chapter 3 - Text and Typography. Completed Exercises 3.03 and 3.04. Watched the Exercise 3.03 and Exercise 3.04 screencasts.

**Thoughts:** Worked too long and ended up running out of time for logging my progress & checking-in on Twitter. So doing a double-update today. Enjoying the exercises, going through each component of the page one step at a time. Tomorrow will be finishing the last component off and putting the final page all together.

### Day 20: January 6, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Still on Chapter 3 - Text and Typography. Finished the Styling Text-Based Elements section by completing Exercise 3.02. Watched the Exercise 3.02 screencast.

**Thoughts:** Got very distracted today. Tried out a couple of different resources – one too basic and a bit rubbish to be honest. The other was very advanced and would end up taking all my time available. I shouldn't really need to get sidetracked with these other resources. I just feel I need some extra practice on some parts of the book. I'll try and stick with W3Schools for the moment, but even then that's quite time-consuming too (and full of it's own distractions). I also spend too much time on social media (i.e. Twitter). Need to cull back on who I follow and try to keep my use balanced - am I really getting as much out of it as the time I'm putting into it? The community part is definitely worth it. Will try and focus just on that and block everything else out. So I wasn't very happy earlier. Wanted to take a break, but wouldn't have enjoyed it knowing I needed to get back on track. So, opened up the book, and soon found my groove again. Can end the day happy and looking forward to continuing tomorrow.

### Day 19: January 5, 2020

**Today's Progress:** More on Chapter 3 - Text and Typography. Completed the (theory) section on Styling Text-Based Elements.

**Thoughts:** Covered a bit more today. Still very straightforward material. Will be starting off tomorrow with Exercise 03-02 which will see me putting all the theory I've learnt over the last couple of days into practice.

### Day 18: January 4, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued with Chapter 3 - Text and Typography. Read Semantic Markup and started reading Styling Text-Based Elements.

**Thoughts:** Not much covered today as I spent most of the time going through W3Schools exercises, and didn't get much sleep last night so my head not really in the game today. Fresh start tomorrow after a good night's sleep.

**Link to work:** [Files 03-13 to 03-17](https://github.com/phildc/html-css-workshop)

### Day 17: January 3, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Started Chapter 3 - Text and Typography. Read the Overview, Introduction and Text-Based Elements. Completed Exercise 3.01 and watched the Exercise 3.01 screencast. Updated my GitHub Pages site.

**Thoughts:** New chapter started today. Very straightforward so far. Peeked ahead and saw majority of this chapter is exercise-based, which is great. Learn so much more by putting everything into practice, rather than just reading. Obviously, you need to do the reading bits first, but by actually coding (some parts again, and again, and again...) I'm starting to remember everything - not just the "how" but the "why".

### Day 16: January 2, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Finished Chapter 2 - Structure and Layout. Completed Exercises 2.04 and 2.05 and watched the Exercise 2.04 and 2.05 screencasts. Completed Activity 2.02 and watched the Activity 2.02 screencast. Read the Summary and completed Quiz 2. Updated my GitHub Pages site.

**Thoughts:** Mostly coding today, not much reading. Learnt a lot while going through the exercises, and really pleased with how the activity went – was able to use what I'd learnt, then stretched myself a little to get the styling and layout to match the wireframe I'd created in Balsamiq. First time using Balsamiq – very intuitive and easy to use. Definitely qoing to use Balsamiq all the time now. Finished off with Quiz 2. Only got 80% but one question was on something that hadn't been included in the chapter, one was a little ambiguous, and one was a bit of a trick question! I read through the correct answers and I'm happy enough to continue - I honestly know the topics well enough, but I'll revisit this quiz later. Overall, really happy with how things are going. Can see a workflow starting to emerge - wireframe > structure > layout - and it's all pretty much "designing in the browser" which is the direction I'd like to go in.

### Day 15: January 1, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Chapter 2 - Structure and Layout. Started The Box Model section. Read the sections on content, padding, border and margin. Completed Exercise 2.03 and watched the Exercise 2.03 screencast.

**Thoughts:** Better day today. Got a lot more done. I've gone back to my old tools setup: Ulysses for writing, Espresso 2 for coding, and Things 2 for organization. Ulysses is the only writing app I've found that makes it easy to embed code snippets in my notes and the daily goals feature is great for keeping me going when I get tired; I prefer Espresso 2 rather than the later versions as you don't have to organize everything into Projects to use the Preview feature; and Things 2 is more than sufficient for what I need without having to pay for Things 3. I've been quite impressed with Visual Studio Code, but I'd had enough with all of the onscreen visual distractions – sometimes it was almost impossible to see the cursor and the code I was writing with so much going on. Espresso is a beautiful experience in comparison. It might not have as many bells & whistles, but to be honest, I much prefer coding by hand with minimal auto-completion. A simple colored syntax scheme keeps me happy and sane. I do like Brackets as well, but I just feel at home with Espresso more than any other code editor. Also, with the extra time (and lack of interruption) I've been able to make good progress with the W3Schools examples I'm using to support my work through the book.

### Day 14: December 31, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Chapter 2 - Structure and Layout. Completed the CSS Page Layouts section. Read the sections on Flex-Based and Grid-Based Layouts. Completed Activity 2.02 and watched the Activity 2.02 screencast.

**Thoughts:** Should be settled back in tomorrow. Will start the Box Model section. The CSS Page Layouts section wasn't very deep. Will need to explore these areas in much more detail - but later (as needed). Must stay focussed.

### Day 13: December 30, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Chapter 2 - Structure and Layout. Completed the Wireframes section. Completed Activity 2.01 and watched the Activity 2.01 screencast. Started the CSS Page Layouts section. Read the section on Float-Based Layouts.

**Thoughts:** Nearly finished up travelling. Tiredness really hitting me hard and not feeling too good. Will be glad for new year to start when I can get settled again for a while. Slow but steady progress today. Tackling Flex and Grid layouts tomorrow.

### Day 12: December 29, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Carried on with Chapter 2 - Structure and Layout. Completed the Structural Elements section. Read about the article, aside, nav and div tags. Completed Exercise 2.01 and watched the Exercise 2.01 screencast.

**Thoughts:** Travelling again today, but completed my goal of finishing this section off and completing the first exercise of this chapter. All straightforward so far, and after an activity on wireframes tomorrow, I'll be starting the section on layout. I've struggled with layout in the past and this will be the first time I've looked at the new flexbox and grid layouts. I've got a few hours layover while travelling so I should be able to dedicate some time to this.

### Day 11: December 28, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Started Chapter 2 - Structure and Layout. Read Overview, Introduction, and started Structural Elements section. Read about the header, footer and section tags.

**Thoughts:** Again, travelling most of the day but managed to make a start on Chapter 2. Starts with a large section on Structural Elements and got about half-way through that section. Should be able to finish this section off tomorrow before having a go at the first exercise of this chapter.

### Day 10: December 27, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Finished Chapter 1 - Introduction to HTML and CSS. Read Dev Tools, How a Web Page Renders, and Chapter 1 Summary. Completed Quiz 01.

**Thoughts:** Spent most of the day travelling, so was very tired at the end of the day, but still managed to get a couple of hours work under my belt. Definitely wanted to make sure I finished Chapter 1 today! The section on how a web page is rendered was fascinating. Can't believe how complex it is to render a simple web page – nevermind then throwing a whole load of JavaScript into the mix. Makes me have a new-found appreciation for browser manufacturers, and how as web developers we really need to understand what is going on under-the-hood. There is a great amount of respect we need to give to the whole process so we are not making our pages overly difficult to render. If we do not, then users will suffer from slow to render, slow to process pages, which is not in anyone's interests. Also, very happy with my Quiz result of 93%. Only got one answer wrong, and that's because I didn't read the question properly! Would have done a face-palm if I wasn't so exhausted.

### Day 9: December 26, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Chapter 1 - Introduction to HTML and CSS. Read CSS Specificity and The Special Case of !important. Completed Activity 1.02 and watched Activity 1.02 screencast. Updated my GitHub Pages website

**Thoughts:** Great explanation of specficity and !important. Think I've *finally* got those concepts. Completed the activity pretty smoothly – must remember that box-sizing declaration block! Caught up with some W3School examples too.

### Day 8: December 25, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Chapter 1 - Introduction to HTML and CSS. Completed Exercise 1.07 and watched Exercise 1.07 screencast. Completed section on CSS Selectors. Updated my GitHub Pages website

**Thoughts:** Finished re-organising all my files on GitHub. Now have a new W3Schools repository to contain all the example code snippets that I've worked through to support my reading. This should allow me to work faster through the book but still make sure I fully-understand everything.

### Day 7: December 24, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Still on Chapter 1 - Introduction to HTML and CSS. More reading about CSS Selectors: Universal Selector, Attribute Selectors, Pseudo-classes, and Combining Selectors.

**Thoughts:** Getting really bogged down with all the different CSS selectors. The book is very good at describing all the different types of selectors, but doesn't include an individual example for each of the different types. Which is fair enough, otherwise the chapter would be huge. However, reading about the selectors isn't the same as actually playing with them, so I've been trying to come up with my own examples where I can put each different selector to use. This is generally what I've been doing with each bit of new code that's been introduced in the book so far, unless there's a specific example that's already been provided. Unfortunately, it's now taking a long time to cover just one paragraph, as there's quite a lot of new code in this section. My solution has been to turn to W3Schools.com for some ready-made examples, so I can see everything in action and have a play with them without spending too long on each section of the book. I've updated my file organization on GitHub to take this into consideration. I've also created a new W3Schools-specific repository to contain the examples that I've gone through.

### Day 6: December 23, 2019

**Today's Progress:** More reading Chapter 1 - Introduction to HTML and CSS. Finished reading the first part of the CSS Selectors section. Read the section on Element, ID, and Class.

**Thoughts:** Slow day today as I was catching up with some sleep after travelling most of the previous day. Felt good to get some CSS code snippets up-and-running as small demo files. Also updated the CSS I'm using for my GitHub Pages site – now using the GitHub Markdown CSS I found on GitHub. I'll tweak that later; just wanted something a bit nicer-looking while I get my head around CSS. Hoping to make better progress over the next few days, but each day is one step closer to my goal – even if it is just a small step.

### Day 5: December 22, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Continued reading Chapter 1 - Introduction to HTML and CSS. Read the section on CSSOM. Started the CSS Selectors section.

**Thoughts:** Was on the road most of the day so didn't manage to get a lot completed today. Also came across an error in the code supplied by the book which took a little while to debug. However, this was a really fruitful exercise as it gave me the opportunity to start using the Dev Tools inside Chrome. Did spend a quite a bit of time with the CSSOM code snippets making sure I understood how the code snippets worked. Also had a play around with the first CSS Selectors code snippet too.

### Day 4: December 21, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Continued Chapter 1 - Introduction to HTML and CSS. Read the section on CSS. Completed Exercise 1.05 and 1.06 about Adding Styles, and watched their respective screencasts. Uploaded all code snippets to GitHub and updated my GitHib Pages site.

**Thoughts:** Not a lot done today as I have an early start tomorrow morning and couldn't do my usual late-night coding session. Still it was nice to get started with some CSS and looking forward to playing with the CSSOM tomorrow.

### Day 3: December 20, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Read more from Chapter 1 - Introduction to HTML and CSS. Read the sections on "Mistakes in HTML" and "Validating HTML". Completed two more exercises and watched the screencasts for them. Continued to play around with code snippets in VSCode. Finished my first activity from the book. All new code uploaded to GitHub. GitHub Pages site updated.

**Thoughts:** Steady, if not spectacular, progress today. Spending more time each day looking at the HTML Living Standard. And if the standard isn't clear or doesn't answer my question, I've been using the MDN, W3Schools and StackOverflow for clarification. For example, learning to put my meta charset before the title element. The first activity was very straightforward and I correctly completed it without having to refer to the given solution. The later activities will be a good test to see if everything else is sinking in as much. Looking forward to starting the CSS section tomorrow!

### Day 2: December 19, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Continued reading Chapter 1 - Introduction to HTML and CSS. Finished the HTML section and read Structuring an HTML Document. Completed the first two exercises and watched the exercise screencasts. Carried on using VSCode to experiment with all the code snippets. Uploaded those snippets again to GitHub, along with the two exercises. Set up a website using GitHub Pages. Created a branch of my main code repository so I could publish my completed exercises. Learnt how to create a pull request and successfully merged my changes.

**Thoughts:** A very productive day! Learnt a lot about the different metadata you can include in the head of an HTML document. Was good to work through my first exercises instead of just playing with small code snippets. One code snippet was a small piece of JavaScript which I then successfully embedded inside an HTML document without any difficulty. Yay! And after a bit of trial-and-error I got my GitHub Pages site up and running. Took a little longer to work out how to publish the exercises from a different repository but got there in the end. Awesome feeling when everything was finally published and out there on the web! Double that feeling when everything looked great on my phone too!

### Day 1: December 18, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Started reading Chapter 1 - Introduction to HTML and CSS. Finished the Overview and Introduction. Read about two-thirds of the HTML section. Used VSCode to experiment with all the code snippets. Uploaded these snippets to GitHub.

**Thoughts:** This was a really interesting introduction to HTML. I love the new content type categories in HTML5. So much clearer and useful than the block-level/inline distinction in previous versions of HTML.

### Day 0: December 17, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Completed the Workshop Onboarding section. This included installing Chrome and VSCode, along with the "Open in Default Browser" extension. Took the Pre-Assessment Quiz and completed it with a score of 72%.

**Thoughts:** I've recently started coding. After exploring many different resources and ways of learning, I've decided to work through The HTML and CSS Workshop from Packt. I was pleasantly surprised to get such a high score in the quiz, as I'm relatively new to modern HTML and CSS. However, it did highlight some areas I need to focus on – JavaScript, SASS, RWD and working with audio & video.
